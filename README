Created a haunted house 'game' for a school project.
This project was completely done for educational and recreational purposes.
Skills developed:
  - The overlaying of images
  - JavaScript
    - Commands executed upon clicking on buttons
  - CSS
    - Placement and importing of images
    - Absolute + fixed positions
  - HTML
    - Creation of the site + display
Problems encountered:
  - Placing the images over each other correctly
  - The switching between images
    - Resolved by creating different HTML pages instead of changing images.
